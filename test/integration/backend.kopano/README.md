# Grapi Kopano integration tests

This directory contains integration tests for kopano-server with grapi. It uses
falcon's test client and a running kopano-server without users.

## Setup

Requires a running kopano-server and `KOPANO_SOCKET` to be set, the server
should be empty, as in no users since the test creates the required users.

## Adding tests

Tests are written using pytest which uses Python assert's and supports fixtures
to easily create re-usable tests. A test usually only requires a 'client' and
'user' fixture, the user is a python-kopano User object with a new auth_header
property which can be used to authentication to grapi.

## Coverage

Coverage is generated by using `make open-integration-cov`.
